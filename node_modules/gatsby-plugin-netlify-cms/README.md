# gatsby-plugin-netlify-cms

Automatically generates an `admin/index.html` with a default Netlify CMS implementation.

Netlify CMS is a React single page app for editing git based content via API.
Its built for non-technical and technical editors alike, and its super easy to
install and configure. For more details, check out the [docs
site](https://netlifycms.org).

## Install

```shell
npm install --save netlify-cms
npm install --save gatsby-plugin-netlify-cms
```

## How to use

Add the Netlify CMS plugin in your `gatsby-config.js`:

```javascript
plugins: [`gatsby-plugin-netlify-cms`];
```

Then add your Netlify CMS [configuration
file](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/add-to-your-site/#configuration) in
`static/admin/config.yml`.

## Configuration

If you need to customize Netlify CMS, e.g. registering [custom
widgets](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/custom-widgets/#registerwidget) or
styling the [preview
pane](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/customization/#registerpreviewstyle),
you'll need to do so in a js module and provide Gatsby with the path to your
module. In `gatsby-config.js`, instead of simply adding the name of the plugin
to the `plugins` array, you'll need to use an object:

```javascript
plugins: [
  {
    resolve: `gatsby-plugin-netlify-cms`,
    options: {
      // One convention is to place your Netlify CMS customization code in a
      // `src/cms` directory.
      modulePath: `${__dirname}/src/cms/cms.js`,
    },
  },
];
```

The js module might look like this:

```javascript
// Your module must at least include these three imports
import React from "react";
import CMS from "netlify-cms";
import "netlify-cms/dist/cms.css";

// Let's say you've created widget and preview components for a custom image
// gallery widget in separate files
import ImageGalleryWidget from "./image-gallery-widget.js";
import ImageGalleryPreview from "./image-gallery-preview.js";

// Register the imported widget:
CMS.registerWidget("image-gallery", ImageGalleryWidget, ImageGalleryPreview);
```
