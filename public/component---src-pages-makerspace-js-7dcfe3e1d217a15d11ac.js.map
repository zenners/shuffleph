Most commonly\r\n\t   * it's used to animate the mounting and unmounting of a component, but can also\r\n\t   * be used to describe in-place transition states as well.\r\n\t   *\r\n\t   * By default the `Transition` component does not alter the behavior of the\r\n\t   * component it renders, it only tracks \"enter\" and \"exit\" states for the components.\r\n\t   * It's up to you to give meaning and effect to those states. For example we can\r\n\t   * add styles to a component when it enters or exits:\r\n\t   *\r\n\t   * ```jsx\r\n\t   * import Transition from 'react-transition-group/Transition';\r\n\t   *\r\n\t   * const duration = 300;\r\n\t   *\r\n\t   * const defaultStyle = {\r\n\t   *   transition: `opacity ${duration}ms ease-in-out`,\r\n\t   *   opacity: 0,\r\n\t   * }\r\n\t   *\r\n\t   * const transitionStyles = {\r\n\t   *   entering: { opacity: 0 },\r\n\t   *   entered:  { opacity: 1 },\r\n\t   * };\r\n\t   *\r\n\t   * const Fade = ({ in: inProp }) => (\r\n\t   *   <Transition in={inProp} timeout={duration}>\r\n\t   *     {(state) => (\r\n\t   *       <div style={{\r\n\t   *         ...defaultStyle,\r\n\t   *         ...transitionStyles[state]\r\n\t   *       }}>\r\n\t   *         I'm a fade Transition!\r\n\t   *       </div>\r\n\t   *     )}\r\n\t   *   </Transition>\r\n\t   * );\r\n\t   * ```\r\n\t   *\r\n\t   * As noted the `Transition` component doesn't _do_ anything by itself to its child component.\r\n\t   * What it does do is track transition states over time so you can update the\r\n\t   * component (such as by adding styles or classes) when it changes states.\r\n\t   *\r\n\t   * There are 4 main states a Transition can be in:\r\n\t   *  - `'entering'`\r\n\t   *  - `'entered'`\r\n\t   *  - `'exiting'`\r\n\t   *  - `'exited'`\r\n\t   *\r\n\t   * Transition state is toggled via the `in` prop. When `true` the component begins the\r\n\t   * \"Enter\" stage. During this stage, the component will shift from its current transition state,\r\n\t   * to `'entering'` for the duration of the transition and then to the `'entered'` stage once\r\n\t   * it's complete. Let's take the following example:\r\n\t   *\r\n\t   * ```jsx\r\n\t   * state = { in: false };\r\n\t   *\r\n\t   * toggleEnterState = () => {\r\n\t   *   this.setState({ in: true });\r\n\t   * }\r\n\t   *\r\n\t   * render() {\r\n\t   *   return (\r\n\t   *     <div>\r\n\t   *       <Transition in={this.state.in} timeout={500} />\r\n\t   *       <button onClick={this.toggleEnterState}>Click to Enter</button>\r\n\t   *     </div>\r\n\t   *   );\r\n\t   * }\r\n\t   * ```\r\n\t   *\r\n\t   * When the button is clicked the component will shift to the `'entering'` state and\r\n\t   * stay there for 500ms (the value of `timeout`) before it finally switches to `'entered'`.\r\n\t   *\r\n\t   * When `in` is `false` the same thing happens except the state moves from `'exiting'` to `'exited'`.\r\n\t   *\r\n\t   * ## Timing\r\n\t   *\r\n\t   * Timing is often the trickiest part of animation, mistakes can result in slight delays\r\n\t   * that are hard to pin down. A common example is when you want to add an exit transition,\r\n\t   * you should set the desired final styles when the state is `'exiting'`. That's when the\r\n\t   * transition to those styles will start and, if you matched the `timeout` prop with the\r\n\t   * CSS Transition duration, it will end exactly when the state changes to `'exited'`.\r\n\t   *\r\n\t   * > **Note**: For simpler transitions the `Transition` component might be enough, but\r\n\t   * > take into account that it's platform-agnostic, while the `CSSTransition` component\r\n\t   * > [forces reflows](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group/blob/5007303e729a74be66a21c3e2205e4916821524b/src/CSSTransition.js#L208-L215)\r\n\t   * > in order to make more complex transitions more predictable. For example, even though\r\n\t   * > classes `example-enter` and `example-enter-active` are applied immediately one after\r\n\t   * > another, you can still transition from one to the other because of the forced reflow\r\n\t   * > (read [this issue](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group/issues/159#issuecomment-322761171)\r\n\t   * > for more info).

Most commonly\r\n   * it's used to animate the mounting and unmounting of a component, but can also\r\n   * be used to describe in-place transition states as well.\r\n   *\r\n   * By default the `Transition` component does not alter the behavior of the\r\n   * component it renders, it only tracks \"enter\" and \"exit\" states for the components.\r\n   * It's up to you to give meaning and effect to those states. For example we can\r\n   * add styles to a component when it enters or exits:\r\n   *\r\n   * ```jsx\r\n   * import Transition from 'react-transition-group/Transition';\r\n   *\r\n   * const duration = 300;\r\n   *\r\n   * const defaultStyle = {\r\n   *   transition: `opacity ${duration}ms ease-in-out`,\r\n   *   opacity: 0,\r\n   * }\r\n   *\r\n   * const transitionStyles = {\r\n   *   entering: { opacity: 0 },\r\n   *   entered:  { opacity: 1 },\r\n   * };\r\n   *\r\n   * const Fade = ({ in: inProp }) => (\r\n   *   <Transition in={inProp} timeout={duration}>\r\n   *     {(state) => (\r\n   *       <div style={{\r\n   *         ...defaultStyle,\r\n   *         ...transitionStyles[state]\r\n   *       }}>\r\n   *         I'm a fade Transition!\r\n   *       </div>\r\n   *     )}\r\n   *   </Transition>\r\n   * );\r\n   * ```\r\n   *\r\n   * As noted the `Transition` component doesn't _do_ anything by itself to its child component.\r\n   * What it does do is track transition states over time so you can update the\r\n   * component (such as by adding styles or classes) when it changes states.\r\n   *\r\n   * There are 4 main states a Transition can be in:\r\n   *  - `'entering'`\r\n   *  - `'entered'`\r\n   *  - `'exiting'`\r\n   *  - `'exited'`\r\n   *\r\n   * Transition state is toggled via the `in` prop. When `true` the component begins the\r\n   * \"Enter\" stage. During this stage, the component will shift from its current transition state,\r\n   * to `'entering'` for the duration of the transition and then to the `'entered'` stage once\r\n   * it's complete. Let's take the following example:\r\n   *\r\n   * ```jsx\r\n   * state = { in: false };\r\n   *\r\n   * toggleEnterState = () => {\r\n   *   this.setState({ in: true });\r\n   * }\r\n   *\r\n   * render() {\r\n   *   return (\r\n   *     <div>\r\n   *       <Transition in={this.state.in} timeout={500} />\r\n   *       <button onClick={this.toggleEnterState}>Click to Enter</button>\r\n   *     </div>\r\n   *   );\r\n   * }\r\n   * ```\r\n   *\r\n   * When the button is clicked the component will shift to the `'entering'` state and\r\n   * stay there for 500ms (the value of `timeout`) before it finally switches to `'entered'`.\r\n   *\r\n   * When `in` is `false` the same thing happens except the state moves from `'exiting'` to `'exited'`.\r\n   *\r\n   * ## Timing\r\n   *\r\n   * Timing is often the trickiest part of animation, mistakes can result in slight delays\r\n   * that are hard to pin down. A common example is when you want to add an exit transition,\r\n   * you should set the desired final styles when the state is `'exiting'`. That's when the\r\n   * transition to those styles will start and, if you matched the `timeout` prop with the\r\n   * CSS Transition duration, it will end exactly when the state changes to `'exited'`.\r\n   *\r\n   * > **Note**: For simpler transitions the `Transition` component might be enough, but\r\n   * > take into account that it's platform-agnostic, while the `CSSTransition` component\r\n   * > [forces reflows](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group/blob/5007303e729a74be66a21c3e2205e4916821524b/src/CSSTransition.js#L208-L215)\r\n   * > in order to make more complex transitions more predictable.
